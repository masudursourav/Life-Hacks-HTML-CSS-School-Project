        <p>Essentially, it means self help.  Or at best, tricks to make your life better.  
I'm guessing a defender of the phrase would say you can 'break in and change your own life against your own will' or something, but again, I think that's nonsense.

I actually cringe at the phrase, I think it is silly.  Trying too hard to sound modern and cool.  
Self Help, Self Development, Tips to Improve your life;  all too old fashioned.  Hacking (breaking into computers) - that's cool.  So breaking into your own life and making changes - that sounds cool.</p>
